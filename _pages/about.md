I am a postdoctoral fellow at the University of South Carolina. I received my B.S., and M.S. degrees from Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xiâ€™an, China in 2016, and 2019, respectively, and Ph. D. degree from the University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC, USA in 2023. My research focuses on path planning, computer vision, edge/GPU computing, optimization, and machine learning. I enjoy many sports, such as badminton, volleyball, tennis, table tennis, and swimming. I also have a passion for outdoor activities like skiing and hiking, as well as engaging hobbies like singing and traveling.
