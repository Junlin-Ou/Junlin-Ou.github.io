My research focuses on path planning, computer vision, edge/GPU computing, optimization, and machine learning. With path planning being a computationally demanding task, I am developing efficient algorithms that can be implemented on edge devices, and leveraging GPU computing to accelerate the path planning process. My ultimate goal is to improve the performance and autonomy of robots across various domains, including manufacturing, healthcare, and space exploration.
